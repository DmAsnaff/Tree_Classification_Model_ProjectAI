# Tree Species Classification in Rajarata University Garden

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for a project aimed at developing a neural network to classify three tree species found in a university garden: Millettia pinnata (Pongamia/Indian Beech), Bougainvillea glabra, and Ficus benjamina L. The project involves collecting physical measurements from these trees and using the data to train and test a neural network model.

### Introduction

This project addresses the challenge of visually distinguishing between three similar tree species by using a neural network to classify them based on physical measurements.

### Overview of Selected Species

The project focuses on three tree species found in the university garden: Millettia pinnata, Bougainvillea glabra, and Ficus benjamina L. These species are visually similar, making them challenging to distinguish through observation alone.

### Dataset Preparation

The methodology involves several key steps:


#### Methodology Used for Data Collection
![Methodology Used for Data Collection](Tree_Species/Methodology_tree_classifier.png)


1. **Field Survey**: Collecting physical measurements from the selected tree species.
2. **Selection of Sampling Sites**: The sites within the university garden where each of the three tree species is found.
3. **Identification and Tagging**: Trees were initially identified by our basic knowledge (for some trees there were QR codes
found in our university context) to ensure correct species identification.
4. **Measurement Protocols**: Leaf Length (cm): Distance from the base to the tip of the leaf.
Leaf Width (cm): Maximum width of the leaf.
Leaf Angle that constructs between leaf base and its petiole (Degree)
5. **Data Recording**: All measurements were manually recorded in a field notebook and later transferred to an
electronic spreadsheet for analysis.

### Details on the Training and Testing Datasets

- Measurements Per Tree: 100 leaves per tree
Total Leaf Measurements: 100 leaves/species × 3 species = 300 leaf samples

- Dataset Features
For each leaf sample:
• Leaf Length (cm)
• Leaf Width (cm)
• Leaf Angle that constructs between leaf base and its petiole (Degree)

- Training Set: 70% of the total samples (0.7 × 300 = 210 leaf samples)
- Testing Set: 30% of the total samples (0.3 × 300 = 90 leaf samples)

### Architecture of the proposed Model

The neural network architecture includes:

- **Input Layer**: 32 units with ReLU activation
- **Hidden Layer**: 32 units with ReLU activation
- **Output Layer**: 3 units with softmax activation
